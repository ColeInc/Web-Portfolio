**To run the files that are inside Source Code:**

You'll need to download a clone of the source code folder that was on the last page, then from there you just need to copy all of the
.html .css and .js files into the src directory of the todo-list folder that you have on your computer.
From there you simply follow the commands of running the code in general above, and you'll be running our website on its latest version.
